# money_store: a lightweight DOM manipulation library inspired by jQuery

money_store is a lightweight DOM manipulation library that implements much of the functionality of jQuery. It implements many of jQuery's most popular and useful functions in a much smaller format.

## Basic Setup

If you don't already have the npm module webpack installed, you'll want to do that first. From there, run 'webpack' in the 'money_store' directory to compile the various source files into a single, easy-to-include library.

## Features rundown

Broadly speaking, money_store provides much of the basic functionality and flexibility of jQuery. It can:

* Select and store DOM elements
* Perform manipulation on stored elements including:
  * Class and style manipulation
  * Adding of event listeners
  * Inner HTML updating
* Accept functions and only run them when the page is ready
* Streamline XMLHttpRequests much like jQuery's AJAX
